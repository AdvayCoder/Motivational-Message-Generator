# Motivating Message Generator

  

This creates a random motivating message every time you run it!

  

## How to use it

  

To use it, download this code and open the folder. _Note: You don't need to pay attention to anything except the "app.js" file._ You will need a **terminal* and ***Node js*.  To use it, open up the terminal, and enter the command
```
node app.js
```
It will generate a random motivating message for you!  Run the same command again to get another message.
